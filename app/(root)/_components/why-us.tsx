        Chelsea Portland House was established by Hasan Balaghi, a
        British-qualified lawyer and co-founder of Balaghi & Rose Solicitors,
        after identifying a recurring challenge faced by overseas law firms,
        international businesses, investors and private clients with interests
        in the United Kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through his work with international clients, Hasan regularly encountered
        situations where legal or professional advice alone was not sufficient.
        Clients often required a trusted presence within the UK to facilitate
        introductions, engage with stakeholders, attend meetings, oversee
        projects and assist with commercial matters connected to the United
        Kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many overseas law firms, their clients required practical support on
        the ground in addition to legal advice. Likewise, international
        businesses and investors frequently needed local representation to help
        navigate opportunities, manage projects and maintain momentum across
        their UK interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chelsea Portland House was established to fulfil that role. Drawing upon
        legal knowledge, commercial experience and an extensive network of
        professional contacts, Chelsea Portland House provides overseas law
        firms and their clients with a trusted UK presence, offering practical
        support, commercial engagement and local representation where UK-based
        involvement is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Chelsea Portland House works alongside overseas law firms,
        businesses, investors and private clients who are either entering the UK
        market or managing existing UK interests. Whether supporting a business
        expansion, investment, transaction, project or commercial matter, our
        objective is simple: to provide the local presence, commercial insight
        and practical assistance needed to help clients achieve their objectives
        in the United Kingdom
